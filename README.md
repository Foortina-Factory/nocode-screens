# NoCode Screens

NoCode Screens is a list of mobile screens ready-to-use for developers. The first goal of this to serve our NoCode tool we are building step by step for the community. You can try it [here](https://nocode.foortinafactory.com) 

1. The first step is to create a lot of various screens.

2. The second step is to customize them online (color, text, background) through our tool.

3. The third step is to select all the screens you want for your mobile application and link them together, adding logic, etc...

4. The last step will be to have logic blocks and backend services to create a full working application using interface only and be able to get an APK file and the full source code only with mouse and keyboard :)

We want it to be fun and without any pressure, and we hope to have more people working on this with us.

With time, we will release others components of the NoCode project.

## Requirements

For now the project is based on Nativescript-Vue because we love it and (we are lazy people also) but we plan to extend to other versions of Nativescript later. 

The project is based on Nativescript 8 but should work for previous version.

## Usage

Clone the repository and copy the view you want directly to your project. If you want to see how screen looks like. Check it [here](https://nocode.foortinafactory.com)


## Contributing

We will be glad to have you contributing to the projects. All the screens here are open to use without restrictions. You can basically copy the code and paste it in your project. So if as a designer or a developer who is okay with that, just write us or make a pull request to add more screens to this collection. 

## Notice 

### Feedback
We are new to the open-source world, so we can make some mistakes. We would love to get any feedback to make the project more useful to everyone. Starting from the right license, typos, better way to write code, etc...

We want to hear and learn from you ðŸ˜Ž

### Copyright

For the beginning, we take inspiration on platforms like dribble. We try to put the link to the original work every time. If you don't want your work to be here, we will remove them from the repository and the website. We will soon be using our designer work to avoid any issues with that.

And of course any designer help would be appreciated.
